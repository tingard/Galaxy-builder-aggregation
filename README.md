# Galaxy builder aggregation

This is a collection of scripts and jupyter notebooks used to perform data reduction and aggregation on the output classifications of Galaxy Builder

Current pipelines:

- [Spiral arm extraction](spiral-aggregation)
- [Disk, bulge, bar clustering](component-clustering)

Generic useful scripts can be found in `/lib`, which is symlinked to each of the working directories.

Don't even get me started on the list of Python dependancies....
